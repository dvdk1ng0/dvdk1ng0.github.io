The most famous conspiracy in the world is the assasination of Jesus Christ. Chief priests and elders met in the cover of darkness and plotted to kill Our Lord and Savior because they were afraid of his power. They drew him up on false charges. They turned someone in his inner circle. They manipulated the justice system. Ever since their evil scheme transpired, being crucified has been synonymous with being a victim of conspiritorial forces. Wasn't it only a few years ago that the Vatican officially forgave the Jews?

Of course, God forknew and sactioned all of this. Even more, it was His conspiracy all along. It was a plot He was waiting to unfold from the beginning, from before He was separating the light from the darkness and (rather questionably) creating plants and trees before the Sun. Yes, yes, the usual questions about human agency in the light of God's omnipotence that have dogged theologians for millenia naturally will arise if we think about this too hard. So let's attempt to side step all of that in favor of a simpler question: What, exactly, was the plot?



 Matt 26 
 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, 4 and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. 5 “But not during the festival,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”

 14 Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests 15 and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver. 16 From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.

Last Supper

Jesus predicts Judas' betrayal and Peter's denial

Gethsemene + sleeping

Judas + Large crowds arrest him

Peter cuts off an ear

Jesus is accused of blasphemy

Peter disowns jesus

Pilate 

Crown of thorns

wine sponge

Two rebels

51 At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split 52 and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. 53 They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and[e] went into

Joseph of Armithea 

guards + seal so that disciples don't steal the body

Mary and the other mary 

Goes to galilee, meets disciples on mountain

Mountain: 17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.


Mark

No rising of dead bodies

Salome was there

No guards

anoint jesus's body. They intended to roll the stone away. But they got there and an angel told them to go to gallilee, not jesus himself. But they don't tell anyone. 

Everything after this has a big asterisk. 

Then Jesus appears to Mary magdelene, then two other unknamed disciples, then the Eleven

they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”

He gets taken up, but not on a mountain

Luke

Satan enters Judas

some event planning details

Judas doesn't get explicitly called out

Pilate passes him off to Herod before he's returned back to do the Barabbas stuff

Curtain of the temple still rips but darkness instead of an earthquake

"The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee" come to bring perfume and spices find the tomb empty and 2 men tell them to go to Gallillee. Peter runs to check and sees the empty tomb. 

Then another two men walk and eat with a guy who turns out to be Jesus, who admonishes them for not believing he has risen.

Then those two go tell the Eleven in Jerusalem, who are already claiming Jesus appeared to Simon. But then as they're talking Jesus appears and lets them touch him and he eats fish with them. 

Then he leads them to Bethany and he gets taken up into heaven. 


John

Judas betrays after the last supper

A lot more explicit about the fact that he's about to die annd even begs for it in 17. and that the disciples will face viscious persecution

He gets brought to Annas, Caiaphas' father in law. 

Pierce side with spear.

Only mary magdelene sees stone rolled away. Peter and John go check and see the empty tomb. Mary hangs around, then two angels show up, and then Jesus himself shows up. 

Jesus appears to the Eleven twice in a locked room, without and then with Thomas. 

Then Jesus does a fishing miracle

Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.

Jesus forgives peter for the whole denying him thing

This seems to be the only book where the author explictly claims to be John, one of the original disciples. But that's not true because it was written in like, 90 AD.
