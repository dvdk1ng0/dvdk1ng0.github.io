I'm a communist, but so what? What does that even mean? There is no commune, no guerilla group, no Party, no organization of workers, no vanguard, no revolution. It's just a belief I have in my head. An opinion. It can only be expressed through empty gestures. Shall I wait in line on election day to write in Patrice Lumumba? What do I get for it except the satisfaction of being right? Of ridiculing wrong-thinking idiots? Of being able to say "I told you so" in the climate change bunker? At the end of things, no extra points will be doled out for having had the right opinion. I just read certain books and agree with them. That's the whole of my "communism."
