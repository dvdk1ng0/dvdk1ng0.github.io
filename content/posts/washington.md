/The liberals and intellectuals are laughing you, you, an uneducated man of the praries and the plains. You're an honest worker, a loyal patriotic citizen, a man who appreciates the glory and wonder of Nature with a capital N. But you're not smooth and slick like them. You're not 'wised up' enough. Those bastards in Washington, drinking and lying all day, they think you're stupid. Boy, this country is heading in the wrong direction. 

The children are your only hope, those shapeless bastions of innocence waiting to be formed. Boy, if we could just get all those city kids out into the country, out into nature, even just for a summer, if we could just show them the /real/ America before they get indoctrinated into a /cosmopolitan/ way of life, maybe we'd have a chance. Boy, if we could just get one of /our/ guys into Washington... Not elected of course, that whole system is broken. Maybe an unlikely appointment to a vacant congressional seat, something like that, someone to get in there and knock some sense into those fools. God willing, we can take our country back from those college types who are out to ruin it./

I've been watching some older films lately: Double Indemnity (awesome), Sunset Boulevard (what if Dracula was a woman?), Rope (they're gay), Citizen Kane (Paddington 2 is better), Point Blank (give that man his 93,000 dolalrs), and Day of the Jackal (10/10, never has a 2.5 hour movie with no music been so thrilling). So naturally I put on Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.... BOOOOO

I'm more than 80 years late to the party, so I won't go on complaining about how reactionary the movie is. The white-male-ness, the nearly fetishistic patriotism, blah blah blah. It's 1939, fine. 

But it's just so embarassing that we've been having this grads vs trads cultural and political divide/standoff/war for almost a century. Maybe even longer. The same persecution complex and grievances against educated liberals in cities and the same corresponding distate for the inelegant mass of raci- I mean conservative Middle Americans. "Mr. Smith Combats Woke-ness in Washington" is phrase I have rotating around in my head. America.exe is not responding. Maybe it's time to click force quit on this whole thing. I guess that's what a lack of class politics does to a mf.
