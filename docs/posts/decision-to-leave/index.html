        <p><em>Decision to Leave</em> (2022) may have set the South Korean film renaissance back 20 years. When I found out the director of <em>Oldboy</em> and <em>The Handmaiden</em> had come out with a new movie, I was completely willing to entrust him with 2 hours and 18 minutes of my time. Now I’m thinking they gave Park Chan-wook Best Director at Cannes because they all felt bad for him.</p>
<p>The idea that there’s an inherent romance in the cop/suspect relationship is a cool and interesting one, even if the movie that came out of it sucks. And Chan-wook has not gone so far astray that the film doesn’t have some killer moments. “What time together? … When I embraced you and whispered I was happy?” is a gut punch. There’s the scene where Seo Rae is wearing a headlamp and her face transforms into a brilliant star, which was kind of cool. And Seo Rae’s, “I came to Ipo to be one of your unsolved cases. Put me on your wall and think of me only” is romantic, I guess. But “Killing is like smoking, only the first time is hard” is on the border between totally sick and wanna-be noir.</p>
<p>Regardless, these sparks of competence couldn’t star a forest fire in Oregon. By the time Hae-joon is shouting for Seo Rae while standing directly above the place where she already drowned herself under the sand in high tide, I was not thinking, “How beautifully sad and poetic,” I was thinking, “Dear God, is this fucking movie over yet?”</p>
<p>I can do a slow film. 2019’s <em>Burning</em>, a South Korean masterpiece, operates at an unhurried, expertly controlled crawl until the final moments that make it all worth it. I can do stomach-crushing ambitious endings like the one in Bong Joon Ho’s classic <em>Memories of Murder</em>. But when it comes to Chan-wook’s latest, dull drivel, I should have made the <em>decision to leave</em> the theater. 0/10</p>
<p>P.S. What’s with the phones! Too many phones! Enough with the phone stuff!!
