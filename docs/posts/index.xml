      <title>Book Review - Infinite Jest</title>

      <description>I finished this book the same day I completed my switch to a flip phone. So it was a timely read for me, given that and also given my quest over the past year to become less stimulated. The experience of reading Infinite Jest, the experience of chugging through the never-ending pages and footnotes, shores up a main theme of the novel: that there’s something to be had when you give up the pursuit of pure pleasure and that there’s something obscene - maybe even deadly - about indulgent bliss.</description>

      <title>Movie Review - Avatar: The Way of Water</title>
      <link>http://dvdk1ng0.github.io/posts/avatar/</link>

      <description>Have you ever looked your father in the eye? And told him, the way of water has no beginning and no end?
It’s a movie so earnest you sometimes have to avert your eyes.
It’s 3 hours long, a nature documentary and an action film rolled into one.
And it’s new. It’s actually something new. It’s a mega-blockbuster that doesn’t exclusively rely on nostalgia. It has sprung from James Cameron’s mind like Athena from Zeus.</description>

      <description>Parable of the Sower - least charismatic teenage girl starts the least interesting religion in the world. 1 trash can.
Brave New World - a British man is very afraid of contraception and pre-marital sex. 2 trash cans
American Pastoral - Am I supposed to give a fuck about this guy? Because I don’t. 3 trash cans.
Moby Dick - Okay, yeah. It’s good.</description>

      <title>Book Review - The Overstory</title>

      <description>It’s the tree book. We love those trees, don’t we, folks? When I was on twitter - a dark time - I would see people throw around this word: eco-fascism. And at first I was like, y’all are just making shit up now, huh? But it’s probably not what you think. It’s not saying that environmental regulations are fascist or that all vegans are secretly nazis. As far as I could tell, it’s used to describe people who are really into the idea of over-population and de-population (of specific groups, of course) and are big fans of Malthus.</description>

      <title>Text Message Review - My Father&#39;s &#39;Guidelines&#39;</title>

      <description>I received this text message from my father a long time ago, 2013, 2014, maybe? I had done something wrong, something sinful. I don’t remember what. What I do remember is copying the message - barely reading it - and pasting it into the notes app on my iPhone (that’s, The iPhone, the first one). I remember that I didn’t understand it at the time, and I thought I might understand it later.</description>

      <title>An Argument for the Reasonableness of Suicide</title>

      <description>You are in pain.
Some days you feel okay, occasionally you feel very good, dangerously good, but most days you feel very sad. This sadness is a physical, full-body feeling, accompanied by psychic misery. You can remember feeling this way even when you were very young.
You do your best anyway. You study and get good grades. You work out, eat healthy, and get 8 hours of sleep. You try not to drink so much.</description>

      <title>Advertisement Review - The Overnight Walk</title>
      <link>http://dvdk1ng0.github.io/posts/overnight-walk/</link>

      <description>“One night. One goal. Stop suicide. June 4th 2022” Though they’re a few months old by now, I still see the posters around town. An overnight walk in support of suicide prevention is a decent metaphor, actually. I’ll give them that. There are people - loved ones - who live in permanent darkness, and the walk is a chance for those who may not be able to understand or relate to commune with the melancholics in the dead of night and into the sunrise.</description>

      <description>“Sinner, you better get ready / Sinner, you better get ready … Hallelujah”
You’ve been told. It doesn’t matter where you are; the warning of God’s judgement has reached your ears. The billboards can be found anywhere in America and beyond, from the most rural parts of the Bible Belt to the gayest, most liberal cities on the coasts. They interrogate you: “Are you ready to meet Jesus?”
Judgment Day has been near for quite some time.</description>

      <description>The flights to Peru were largely empty back when I worked for Delta. Lima probably wasn’t my first choice of destination that Friday afternoon, but in the end it seemed as good a place as any to spend a weekend (or, more accurately, a Saturday). Coincidentally, someone from my church at the time was on the same flight, going on a mission trip. She was on her way to spiritually colonize the same place I picked for my mini-vacation.</description>

      <description>I must unfortunately report that the High Line is now worse than Time Square. TS is the infamous former titleholder of Worst Place in New York, once top of the list of Worst Places but now trounced by Soho, Washington Square Park, etc., and now the High Line too, suffering (the High Line is) from the dual annoyance of 1) foreign tourists, impossibly many, impossibly slow, some with strollers, the frequency of the sound of their dumb, throaty, stupid European languages sharply increasing, then decreasing as I push past them, and 2) runners, sweaty runners trying to push past me like a car aggressively overtaking you only to end up at the stoplight right next to you, like who do you think you are buddy - a terrible combo which has the effect of promoting the High Line over TS (but not WSP, dear god no) in the catalog of Worst Places.</description>

      <title>Movie Review - Bros (2022)</title>
      <link>http://dvdk1ng0.github.io/posts/bros/</link>

      <description>Billy Eichner seems to have written and starred in a romantic comedy while still being on the fence, in real life, about whether he deserves to be loved or not. Perhaps he should have worked that out beforehand, so watching the movie doesn’t feel like violating patient-therapist confidentiality.
Bros (2022) is a bit of a bait and switch. From the title, I guess I thought it’d be a movie about how funny it is to try to be gay without being “gay”.</description>

      <description>When you enter into the military, there’s a film of despair over the whole process. The military is often the last resort, as it certainly was for me, and that feeling, the feeling of being on your last leg, that feeling permeates.
The recruiting station for the section of Atlanta covering Georgia Tech was inside South Dekalb Mall on Candler Rd. It’s in not the worst neighborhood in Atlanta, but it’s not good.</description>

      <title>Movie Review - Decision to Leave (2022)</title>
      <link>http://dvdk1ng0.github.io/posts/decision-to-leave/</link>

      <description>Decision to Leave (2022) may have set the South Korean film renaissance back 20 years. When I found out the director of _Oldboy_and The Handmaiden had come out with a new movie, I was completely willing to entrust him with 2 hours and 18 minutes of my time. Now I’m thinking they gave Park Chan-wook Best Director at Cannes because they all felt bad for him.
The idea that there’s an inherent romance in the cop/suspect relationship is a cool and interesting one, even if the movie that came out of it sucks.</description>
