      <description>Decision to Leave (2022) may have set the South Korean film renaissance back 20 years. When I found out the director of _Oldboy_and The Handmaiden had come out with a new movie, I was completely willing to entrust him with 2 hours and 18 minutes of my time. Now I’m thinking they gave Park Chan-wook Best Director at Cannes because they all felt bad for him.
The idea that there’s an inherent romance in the cop/suspect relationship is a cool and interesting one, even if the movie that came out of it sucks.</description>

      <description>When you enter into the military, there’s a film of despair over the whole process. The military is often the last resort, as it certainly was for me, and that feeling, the feeling of being on your last leg, that feeling permeates.
The recruiting station for the section of Atlanta covering Georgia Tech was inside South Dekalb Mall on Candler Rd. It’s in not the worst neighborhood in Atlanta, but it’s not good.</description>
