        <p>Have you ever looked your father in the eye? And told him, the way of water has no beginning and no end?</p>
<p>It’s a movie so earnest you sometimes have to avert your eyes.</p>
<p>It’s 3 hours long, a nature documentary and an action film rolled into one.</p>
<p>And it’s new. It’s actually something new. It’s a mega-blockbuster that doesn’t exclusively rely on nostalgia. It has sprung from James Cameron’s mind like Athena from Zeus. All those who doubted Cameron’s vision have now been embarrassed and silenced. My god, it’s something new.</p>
<p>Come to the river, all who are thirsty, come and drink.</p>
<p>Thumbs up.</p>
