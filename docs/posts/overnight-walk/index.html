        <p>“One night. One goal. Stop suicide. June 4th 2022” Though they’re a few months old by now, I still see the posters around town. An overnight walk in support of suicide prevention is a decent metaphor, actually. I’ll give them that. There are people - loved ones - who live in permanent darkness, and the walk is a chance for those who may not be able to understand or relate to commune with the melancholics in the dead of night and into the sunrise. A neat idea.</p>
<p>But something about the words “stop suicide” irks me. It’s a small part of the language I’ve heard ever since I’ve taken the idea of suicide seriously.</p>
<p>“Safety.” That’s a better word to help me explain. Therapists, psychologists, whatever, they’ll ask me something like, “Are you feeling safe?” What they mean is, “Do you feel like a danger to yourself?” It’s not difficult to see what this implies. It assumes a split between one part of myself that wants to kill myself and another that is afraid to be harmed. It assumes suicide is an impulse that is sprung upon me in moments when I have no control. “Safety.” It means there’s a rational self underneath all of this that really does want to live and it has to be protected from … me, me and this crazy idea I have. I can’t seem to convince anyone that I experience no such split.</p>
<p>“Hopelessness” There’s another one. “Your pain is real, but so is hope” is the MTA sign. “Are you feeling hopeless?” is the usual interrogative from those concerned. It’s a trick question of sorts. It’s obviously true that complete hopelessness, believing things will <em>always</em> be bad, is usually not a well thought out outlook because, just probabilistically speaking, something good has to happen eventually. So if you state hopelessness as a reason for suicide, if you answer “yes” to that question, you’re freely admitting that you’re unreasonable. It forces the questionee to talk abut suicide in the questioner’s terms. But as much as I try to explain that the possibility of future good events doesn’t make suicide unreasonable, I can’t seem to get that across to anyone. It’s..hopeless, I guess.</p>
<p>“If you ever feel that way, just call me.” They mean well. But how can I explain that the thought of suicide is not an impulse, at least for me? That it isn’t a thought that comes to me in a moment of confusion. It’s with me all the time. There isn’t anything you can say when I call you to make me “snap out of it.”</p>
<p>“Stop suicide.” You have a disease of the will, and we have to counterman your desires. Suicide is unreasonable in every case. You cannot choose it. We won’t let you. You have to live, no matter how awful or miserable it is. You are required to. You have no choice.</p>
<p>But I do have a choice, don’t I?</p>
