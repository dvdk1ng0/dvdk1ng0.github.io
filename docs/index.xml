      <description>Decision to Leave (2022) may have set the South Korean film renaissance back 20 years. When I found out the director of Oldboy and The Handmaiden had come out with a new movie, I was completely willing to entrust him with 2 hours and 18 minutes of my time. Now I’m thinking they gave Park Chan-wook Best Director at Cannes because they all felt bad for him.
The idea that there’s an inherent romance in the cop/suspect relationship is a cool and interesting one, even if the movie that came out of it sucks.</description>
